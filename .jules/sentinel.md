## 2026-01-03 - SSRF Bypass via HTTP Redirects
**Vulnerability:** Standard HTTP libraries like `requests` and `feedparser` follow redirects by default. An attacker can provide a safe URL (e.g., to their own server) that redirects to an internal, sensitive address (e.g., `http://localhost` or `http://169.254.169.254`). This bypasses initial URL validation checks.
**Learning:** Checking a URL with `is_safe_url` *before* the request is insufficient if the library automatically follows redirects. The check must be performed at *every* hop of the redirect chain.
**Prevention:** Use a custom request wrapper (like `safe_requests_get`) that disables automatic redirects (`allow_redirects=False`) and manually handles the redirect loop, validating the `Location` header against the security policy before following it.
